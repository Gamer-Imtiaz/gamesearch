		<h2>Privacy</h2>
		<p>- Use a VPN, stay away from 'Free' VPNs <br>The safest Free VPN is ProtonVPN; their Free USA Server locations allow torrenting</p>
		<p>- Prevent ISP blocks and tracking as well as improve speed with a custom DNS <br>The safest Free DNS servers are Cloudflare (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1) and Google (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)</p>

		<h2>Warnings from r/PiratedGames (Updated Regularly)</h2>
		<p><b>Programs Not to Use</b><p>
		<p>- uTorrent - Very malicious and very dodgy, not only has it included multiple forms of malware in the past (and possibly present) but it's also associated with the world's biggest copyright troll; the MPAA.</p>
		<p>- Bittorrent - Is the exact same program as above</p>
		<p><b>Sites Not to Use</b></p>
		<p>- IGG-Games - Their site has malware, they inject ads into their games, they steal releases and add their own links into them, they constantly lie to their users and they try to profit off stolen releases.</p>
		<p>- Corepack - They upload malware, they lie about their releases and they steal from trusted repackers</p>
		<p>- nosTEAM - Basically the same as above, it's a bit sad we have multiple groups doing the same crappy things that only hurt themselves and everyone else</p>
		<p>- OceanOfGames - They upload malware, nuff' said</p>
		<p>Any sites claiming to be a scene group, such as: SkidrowReloaded, SkidrowGames, SkidrowCrack, CPY-Games, etc.</p>
